## Reference:

## How to run:
 1. From the base directory (Encryptor/), run the command 'dune exec bin/main.exe' to start up the program.
 2. Follow the prompts. Specifically, when it asks for the file to encrypt or decrypt, add data/ before the filename (as a precondition, the program requries your files for encryption/decryption to be in the data folder.)
    - ex. For the provided example file, you'd enter 'data/example.txt'
